The _[American Jewish Yearbook](https://archive.org/details/americanjewishye5671adle/mode/2up)_, which is available on the Internet Archive, shows us that Charlotte was home to a Jewish organization in 1910 called the Hebrew United Brotherhood. This organization got a building and became the city's first synagogue in 1916. If we look at the [1922 Charlotte City Directory](https://archive.org/details/charlottenorthca1922pied), we can see a listing for the Hebrew United Brotherhood listed under the directory's \"Associations and Societies\" section. The information is there, but only if you know to look for it."
