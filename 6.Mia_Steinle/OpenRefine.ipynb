    "The 1911 Charlotte City Directory [is available](https://archive.org/details/charlottenorthca1911pied/page/110/mode/2up) on the Internet Archive. To recreate this exercise from scratch, you can download a PDF version of the directory and run it though an optical character recognition (OCR) program such as ABBYY FineReader to start working with the rough data. Or you can start where I did, with this [CharlotteStarterData](https://cases.umd.edu/user/mialsteinle/doc/tree/mialsteinle/Data/CharlotteStarterData.csv) csv file. This file has been manipulated so the data is partially cleaned up from the original OCR output. You can upload all 15,711 rows into OpenRefine, where it will look like this:\n",

Searching for the term \"church\" is a good start, but it doesn't capture all of the relevant listings. Pages 22-23 in the 1911 Charlotte City Directory include a list of churches that I used as a starting point to search for keywords, including \"chapel,\" \"tabernacle,\" \"salvation army,\" and \"brotherhood.\" Below is one of the expressions I used to indicate that every entry in the \"Orig-copy\" column with the word \"chapel\" in it should be marked as a church."
