    "While on first glance the 1911 Charlotte, North Carolina, city directory is simply a listing of people and businesses, it contains many stories. I took a .csv file of the directory's 15,700 entries — which had been extracted from scanned images of the directory using OCR — to look for stories about places of worship in Charlotte. After cleaning up and transforming the data in OpenRefine, I used Tableau Public to visualize the data. This series of notebooks explains that process, presents my findings from the data, and suggest an avenue for further research and data analysis.\n"
