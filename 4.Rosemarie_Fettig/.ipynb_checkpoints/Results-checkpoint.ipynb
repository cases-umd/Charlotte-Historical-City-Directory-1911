    "\n",
    "It would certainly be possible to expand this project to encompass larger versions of the data set - either the 160 record set used for the original assignment or the full 16,000 record set. However, scalability may be difficult because the data manipulation had to be done manually in Excel. I was not able to use [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) for this project because the data modifications I was executing involved the creation of a large number of new rows, and OpenRefine is not well suited to that. Given more time it may be possible to find an automated workaround for this issue, but it was not feasible within the time constraints of this iteration of the project.\n",

    "## Opening Up Historical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As a proof of concept, this project and its resultant products provide compelling evidence that adjusting data models can open up historical datasets in new ways. Compared to the previously used model, the data model I created allows for queries that drill down deeper into the dataset, separating individual facets in a way that facilitates exploration of the complexities and a more detailed view of the bigger picture. The analytical process applied during the modeling stage of this project could be adapted to fit almost any structured dataset - all that is required is a little flexible thinking.\n",
