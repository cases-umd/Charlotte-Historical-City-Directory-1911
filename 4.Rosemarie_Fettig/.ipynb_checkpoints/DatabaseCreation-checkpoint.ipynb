    "With relational database management systems like MySQL, you typically construct a logical model of your database and then instruct the system to forward engineer the model into a physical database. In Neo4j, you have to write the code to create the database yourself, using the Cypher language, and while this is a little more labor-instensive, it gives you a higher level of control over the creation of the database and more ability to fine-tune things. \n",

    "Eagle-eyed readers will notice that this script doesn't contain a \"MarriedTo\" relationship. That's because creating relationships between nodes of the same type (in this case, person to person) wasn't particularly intuitvive. I found it easier to do two loads: one for the records themselves and the more simple relationships, then a second for the marriage relationships. I relied a lot on Neo4j documentation - [This one](https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/appendix/tutorials/guide-import-relational-and-etl/#_creating_relationships_between_employees) proved particularly helpful - and the kindness of StackOverflow strangers from years past to help me figure it out. In the end, the secondary create script for marriage relationships looked like this: "

    "Since I am by no means fluent in Cypher, there may indeed be more efficient or more elegant solutions out there, but given the nature of this project I was content to patchwork things together to get to the results I wanted. Through research and troubleshooting, I eventually realized that the use of unique identifiers was going to be necessary in order to clearly define the relationships, hence the inclusion of the \"PersonID\" and \"MarriedTo\" columns. These function a lot like primary/foreign keys in relational database systems like SQL â€“ once I made that connection this became a lot easier because of my experience with SQL."

It took a lot of troubleshooting to arrive at the code included above because no matter how conscious I was in my drafting, I still had to test the code to make sure it worked. This process involved a lot of back and forth: draft a load script, run it, see what the graph looked like, find an issue, go back and edit the script, delete the previous version of the database from my server, rinse and repeat.\n",
