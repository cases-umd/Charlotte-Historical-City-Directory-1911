    "- Much of the data couldn't be plotted on the map because their addresses no longer exist for one reason or another. About 2/3 of this data is missing, so any conclusions drawn are ultimately incomplete. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Some of the georeferenced data is not accurate. There were a few instances of people being placed in Oregon, Italy, Paraguay, and South Africa. If there was a way to refine this data to make it more accurate, a better map could be produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The polygons for the 1972 Urban Renewal map should be redrawn. While I just traced where they were on the map, it would be more helpful if I could pinpoint exactly where their boundaries should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The georeferenced addresses didn't match up perfectly on the map, resulting in some areas that probably weren't properly accounted for. E Worthington Ave on the border of B5 and C13 shows a potential error. \n",
    "\n",
    "- An analytical tool such as Tableau or Neo4j could be used to make more insights in the dataset sorted by the HOLC areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The same process could be extrapolated to other cities to see if similar trends exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "- More data could be generated by scanning other directories from different years, although this would take a lot of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If possible, it would be interesting to incorporate newer maps and data, such as the [Mecklenberg/Charlotte Quality of Life Explorer](https://mcmap.org/qol/#19/). "
