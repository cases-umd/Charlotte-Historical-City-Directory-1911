    "The 1911 Charlotte City Directory compiles all the individuals who lived or had a business in Charlotte, NC in addition to businesses in the city. It lists each person alphabetically, along with their addresses, titles, jobs, spouse's name, and so forth. Whilst it is certainly interesting to flip through these records, you may wonder if its really worth preserving old phonebook and directory data beyond familial interests. \n",

    "Through software like OpenRefine and Tableau, we can visualize and understand larger trends in this data that we cannot glimpse on paper. In this notebook, we'll travel back to the streets of Charlotte in 1911 to try to understand what life was like through two important facets: jobs and housing. In comparing these data points, we'll be able to gain a new sliver of understanding about the prosperity and security of people at that time.  \n",
