    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook outlines a project undertaken to better understand the data contained in the 1911 Charlotte City Directory, which has been digitized and uploaded onto the Internet Archive. The ultimate goal of this project was to take the addresses listed for everyone in the directory, find the areas of Charlotte that were the most heavily populated, and identify demographic trends across those different areas, paying special attention to any patterns that came up along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project utilizes three different tools to edit, clean, map, and visualize this data: OpenRefine, QGIS, and Tableau. These three tools are descirbed briefly below, and each of their respective involvements in this particular project is outlined in the following notebooks. In the final notebook, there is a Tableau Public Story outlining my findings.\n",

    "The goal of this project was to come up with a different way of conceptualizing the raw data of around 16,000 residents listed in the 1911 Charlotte City Directory. As a class, we have worked with this data through a number of different computational tools, manipulating and analyzing it using a variety of different methods. My intention was to use several of these different tools to take a closer look at the demographic information of different neighborhoods in Charlotte, and compare those neighborhoods to each other, as well as against the profile of the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ultimately wanted to use Tableau to visually represent the demographic information across the different neighborhoods, but I recognized that I would need to do some work on the front end in order to get there. First, I needed to run the data through OpenRefine in order to clean up the address field into a format that I could process with a geocoding tool, to find latitude and longtiude coordinates for each address. Once I accomplished that, I plugged those addresses into QGIS' geocoding tool and mapped the subsequent plot of addresses onto a map of modern-day Charlotte to identify population centers. Finally, I was able to take those individual population centers, divide them into their own spreadsheets, and upload the data into Tableau to create visual representations of the different neighborhoods.\n",

Using this tool, data can be manipulated at will by the user in easier ways than other spreadsheet tools, such as Excel or Numbers. General trends across certain categories of data can be automatically recognized and grouped together, and similarly-formatted pieces of data can all be manipulated in the same way with a single command. In addition, all the data manipulation takes place locally, on your device, so there is no risk of any unwanted parties having access to your data.
